# Python Conditionals Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects focused on real-life problems using `if-else` conditional statements.

Each script demonstrates how to apply decision-making logic in practical scenarios â€” perfect for new learners who want to strengthen their understanding of Python conditionals.

## ðŸ’¡ Projects Included

1. **Age Classifier**  
   Determines if a person is a Child, Teenager, Adult, or Senior based on age.
